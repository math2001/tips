## Search format

Searching is fairly simple: everything that is between brackets is considered a
tag.

- `[python]` will show tips that have the tag `python`.
- `[python][itsbuiltin]` will show tips that have the both tags `python` and
  `itsbuiltin`
- `hello` will show tips that have their title or their actual content containing the
  word `hello` (case insensitive)
- `[vim] map` will show tips that have the tag `vim` and that have their title or
  content containing `map`.

The search becomes case *sensitive* as soon as there is one capital letter in it.
